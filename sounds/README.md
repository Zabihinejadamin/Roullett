## How to Add Sounds:
1. Place sound files in this `sounds/` directory
2. Ensure filenames match exactly as listed above
3. The game will automatically load and play them at the appropriate times

## Sound Sources:
You can create these sounds yourself or find free casino sound effects online. Search for "casino roulette sounds" or "roulette wheel sounds" for authentic audio.

The game will work perfectly without sound files - they'll simply not play when triggered.
